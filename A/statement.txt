Chef saw Ketu and Petu playing the following game.
- There are n cards placed on a table with each card having a value on it.
- Both of them take their turn alternately with Petu starting the game.
- Petu draws card from the front of the remaining cards.
- Ketu draws card from the back of the remaining cards.
- Both of them gain value written on the card they drew.
- When there is no card remaining, the game ends.
Chef was wondering what will be difference in points earned by Ketu and Petu?


Input:
- The first line of input contains a single number n.
- The second line of input contains n space seperated integers C1, C2, ..., Cn.


Output:
Print a single integer, Ketu's points - Petu's points


Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= C[i] <= 10^3 for each valid i


Example Input:
3
1 4 10


Example Output:
5


Sample Explanation:
Let K be points of Ketu and P be points of Petu.
- Initially, K = 0 and P = 0.
- Petu draws card with value 1 and gains 1 points. So, P = 0 + 1 = 1.
- Ketu draws card with value 10 and gains 10 points. So, K = 0 + 10 = 10.
- Petu draws card with value 4 and gains 4 points. So, P = 1 + 4 = 5.
Hence, the value of K - P = 10 - 5 = 5.
